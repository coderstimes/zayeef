            <h3> The veep stakes   </h3>
            <h6>Ahmed Zayeef . Dhaka</h6>

            <h4> A Chhatra League vice-president now controls the entire area where he once used to sell shoes on the roadside for a living </h4>

            <p class="text-center">
              <img src="assets/works/bsl-shohag.jpg" class="rounded w-50 text-center my-5" alt="...">
            </p>            

            <p class="fst-italic"> For many Chhatra League leaders who hold official posts, the student front of the ruling party has been a stepping stone for rising from decent lives to the ones of luxury, grandeur and power. Even a footpath shoe seller has turned his fortune by rising through the ranks. </p>

            <p>Chhatra League Vice-President Reaj Uddin Reaj was once a shoe vendor. He used to sell shoes in a roadside shop in front of Shundorbon Market in the capital's Fulbaria area near Gulistan.
            </p>


            <p>
              Two shoe vendors from the area narrated how Reaj became a central leader of the rulling party’s student front.
            </p>
            <p> 
              One of them said: “Reaj was one of us. At first he used to sell shoes on the road with us. Then he took a job in a shop near the City Super Market.
            </p>
            <p> 
              “Suddenly, one day we came to know that he had managed a degree from a homeopathy college. Soon he inserted the 'doctor' tag before his name. He also maintained relations with some of the central leaders of Chhatra League,” he said.
            </p>
            <p> 
              A few days they learned that Reaj had got a post in the central committee. “He then established his control over all the roadside shops in the Gulistan area. Now, he owns two flats in capital's Narinda area.
            </p>
            <p> 
              “We [including Reaj] used to have chats after a long day at work. It now seems like a dream when we recall those days and how Reaj's lifestyle has changed overnight.”
            </p>
            <h3>
              Phone call
            </h3>
            <p> 
              When contacted, Reaj's reaction was curtly: “If I say you are a fake journalist, will it be right?”
            </p>
            <p> 
              And then he threatened to file a case against this correspondent before he slammed the phone down.
            </p>
            <p> After a few minutes, as this reporter called Reaj again, he said: “Write that I have six flats in the capital and I am the owner of huge property. I do not want to talk to you anymore.”
            </p>
            <h3> Plastic fantastic </h3>
            <p> 
              Reaj Uddin Chowdhury Shumon, another vice-president of Chhatra League, was originally a resident of Chittagong. He is now the owner of a plastic factory in the capital's Mugdapara.
            </p>
            <p> 
              A source from Chittagong said Shumon had earned Tk28-30 lakh by helping a Dhaka-based construction company get a food depot construction work in Cox's Bazar's Jhilonjha. With the money, Shumon set up his own company.
            </p>
            <p> 
              Regarding this, Shumon said over phone: “Things are not like the way you are saying. Now I am in my hometown [Chittagong]. I will talk to you face to face and clarify everything.” But he has never rung back.
            </p>
            <h3>
              Bricking it
            </h3>
            <p> 
              Another Vice-President Mukhlesur Rahman Shumon is the owner of a brick kiln in Madaripur. The kiln is located beside the Dhaka-Khulna highway in Pulia area of Vanga Upazila of Madaripur.
            </p>
            <p> 
              A number of people from the area said Shumon had grabbed the land to set up his kiln. Brick-loaded trucks have damaged the road leading to the area. “When we protested, he threatened us with dire consequences. After that, we filed a general diary with the Vanga police station.”
            </p>
            <p> 
              Shumon, however, denied the allegation, saying: “My father was a very rich man. He left huge property worth at least Tk150-200 crore. I have had money to burn. A piece of land for setting up a brick kiln is not a big deal.”
            </p>
            <p> 
              But Harun-Or-Rashid, chairman of Ajimnogor Union Parisad, where Mukhlesur lives told the Dhaka Tribune: “I have known Shumon and his family for a long time. They are well-off but not as rich as he claims. He set up the brick kiln after he became a central leader of Chhatra League.
            </p>
            <p> “He also has a fuel station just opposite the brick field,” Harun said. 
            </p>
            <h3> Banner year </h3>
            <p> 
              Vice-President Masud Hasan Turno is the chairman of a digital banner company. His company's office is located in Jhigatola in the capital.
            </p>
            <p> 
              “Turno comes from a very ordinary family. After he secured the post, Turno launched his business. He amassed money by lobbying for jobs and manipulating tenders,” said a Chhatra League central leader who has known Turno for a long time.
            </p>
            <p> 
              Turno, however, said his father had given him the money to start the business. “I do not have any involvement in any kind of lobbying.”
            </p>
            <h3> 
              Feet of clay
            </h3>
            <p> 
              Vice-President Shahinur Rashid Sohel has a ceramic shop in the capitals Monipuripara just near the Sangsad Bhaban. He is also a director of a popular and well-known university admission test coaching centre in the capital's Mirpur.
            </p>
            <p> 
              Sohel said: “As I am from a lower middle-class family, I had to ensure my livelihood. That is why, from the very beginning of my student life, I got involved with the coaching centre.”
            </p>
            <p> 
              Regarding the ceramic business, he said: “I had very little investment there. But by now I have quit the business.”
            </p>
            <p> 
              According to some leaders and activists, there are many other leaders who have become rich overnight. Many of them own more assets than the two top leaders.
